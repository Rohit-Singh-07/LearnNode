Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine that allows
you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server side.

// Although Node.js runs on a single thread, it handles many connections simultaneously using event loops and callbacks.


/*
libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides Node.js with its event-driven,
non-blocking I/O model. 
It abstracts the underlying operating system’s asynchronous I/O operations 
(like file system access, network, timers), 
allowing Node.js to perform efficiently across different platforms.
